ssh

The ssh module is a collection of classes and defines that facilitate
the configuration of the ssh client and multiple listening ssh daemons.

Example
-------

    node my_node {
        class { 'ssh::client': }
        ssh::server { 'default': }
        ssh::server { 'special': port => 2222 }
    }

Installation and Upgrade
------------------------

Since we're installing from a tarball the installation and upgrade process
is the same.  You'll need to set --modulepath if f you're installing the
module in a path other than the location defined in puppet.conf.

    MODULEPATH=/var/lib/puppet/master/production/modules
    puppet module install         \
        --force                   \
        --ignore-dependencies     \
        --module-path $MODULEPATH \
        $PATHTO/master-ssh-$VER.tar.gz

Limitations
-----------

[ ssh_known_hosts ]

Puppet's sshkey resource works well for managing the ssh_known_hosts file
however it is an "all or nothing" solution.  Currently there is no way to
use both a template and the sshkey resource.   Attempts to utilize both
will result in the sshkey resource randomly destroying the templated file
due to Puppet's natural ordering mechanisms.  All attempts to force order
did not work.  As a result the decision was made to make the ssh_known_hosts
file a template only and leave the use of sshkey up to the administrator to
create the necessary local classes.
